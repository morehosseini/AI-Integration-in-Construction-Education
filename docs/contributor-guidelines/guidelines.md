Thank you for contributing to **AI Integration in AEC Education**.
This document outlines the process for submitting chapter drafts, case studies, and teaching resources.

## 👥 For Authors & Contributors

### 1. Where to Upload Your Work
We use a structured folder system. Please navigate to:
`chapters/` → `[Your Section]` → `[Your Chapter]`

Inside your chapter folder, organize files as follows:
* **Text/Manuscripts:** Upload to the `/text` subfolder.
* **Images/Figures:** Upload to the `/text` subfolder (or create an `/images` folder).
* **Data/Spreadsheets:** Upload to the `/datasets` subfolder.
* **Python/Code:** Upload to the `/code` subfolder.

### 2. File Naming Conventions
To maintain order, please use the following naming pattern:
* `Ch01_Draft_v1.docx` (for Word documents)
* `Ch01_Figure_1-1.png` (for images)
* `Ch01_Script_Analysis.py` (for code)
